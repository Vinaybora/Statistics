    "   -  **Mean**: The average of the data.\n",
    "   -  **Median**: The middle value when the data is ordered.\n",
    "   -  **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "   -  **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "   -  **Variance**: A measure of how spread out the data is.\n",
    "   -  **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, representing the average distance from the mean.\n",

    "   -  Graphs such as histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and box plots help to visualize data patterns and distributions.\n"

    "# Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves drawing conclusions from a sample of data based on probability theory. It allows us to make predictions or generalizations about a population based on the data from a sample. Key concepts in inferential statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "- Testing a hypothesis about a population parameter (e.g., mean or proportion) using sample data. This involves calculating a p-value to determine the significance of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence Intervals:\n",
    "- A range of values, derived from the sample data, that is likely to contain the population parameter. For example, a 95% confidence interval means there's a 95% chance the true population parameter lies within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression Analysis:\n",
    "- A method for modeling the relationship between variables. Linear regression, for example, tries to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling:\n",
    "- Methods of selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population to infer conclusions about the population as a whole.\n"
